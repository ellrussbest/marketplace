To save us some time, I created the function calls that i will use:


// used to creat a subAccount within my masterAccount 
near create-account marketcontract.awry.testnet --masterAccount awry.testnet --initialBalance 30

// used to deploy our contract to the NEAR protocol
// now we are going to deploy our contract to the protocol
near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/marketplace.wasm --accountId=marketcontract.awry.testnet

// used to initialize the contract
// we are going to initialize our contract with the new() method
near call marketcontract.awry.testnet new --accountId=awry.testnet

// used to get a specific product from the NEAR protocol
// now we are going to query one specific product from the protocol
near view marketcontract.awry.testnet getProduct '{"id": "product1"}' --accountId awry.testnet

// let's try querying a product that doesn't exist
near view marketcontract.awry.testnet getProduct '{"id": "product22"}' --accountId awry.testnet

// used to get all the products from the NEAR protocol
// we want to check if all the products were uploaded to our contract successfully
near view marketcontract.awry.testnet getProducts --accountId awry.testnet

// used to carry out a purchase transaction
// we now want to try to carry out a purchase
near call marketcontract.awry.testnet buyProduct '{"id": "product1"}' --accountId awry.testnet

// we can confirm the sold amount of product 1... spoiler alert!!! it should be one... we just sold our first product

// i also have front end of my contract... let's see how it works...
