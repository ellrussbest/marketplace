To save us some time, I created the function calls that i will use:


// used to creat a subAccount within my masterAccount 
near create-account marketcontract.awry.testnet --masterAccount awry.testnet --initialBalance 30

// used to deploy our contract to the NEAR protocol
near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/marketplace.wasm --accountId=marketcontract.awry.testnet

// used to initialize the contract
near call marketcontract.awry.testnet new --accountId=awry.testnet

// used to get a specific product from the NEAR protocol
near view marketcontract.awry.testnet getProduct '{"id": "product20"}' --accountId awry.testnet

// used to get all the products from the NEAR protocol
near view marketcontract.awry.testnet getProducts --accountId awry.testnet

// used to carry out a purchase transaction
near call marketcontract.awry.testnet buyProduct '{"id": "product1"}' --accountId awry.testnet
